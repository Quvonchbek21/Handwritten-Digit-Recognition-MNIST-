# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-MNIST
🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)

📘 Goal:
Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize handwritten digits (0–9).

🧠 Skills Practiced:
Convolution layers, Softmax activation, accuracy evaluation, and training loops.

📦 Dataset:
torchvision.datasets.MNIST

🔧 Tools & Libraries:

PyTorch

NumPy

Matplotlib

Gradio (for web interface)

💡 Extra Feature:
The project includes a Gradio web interface that lets users draw digits on a canvas and get instant predictions from the trained model.

Final Accuracy: ~99.18% on the test set.
